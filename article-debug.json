This program aims to deliver essential health messages directly to millions of daily commuters. The campaign covers a range of important topics, including women's safety, mental health support, and the importance of digital inclusion in accessing healthcare resources. One of the focal points of the initiative is the Pre-Conception and Prenatal Diagnostic Techniques (PC-PNDT), which emphasizes the need for proper prenatal care and early detection of health issues. Additionally, the campaign raises awareness about tuberculosis, a critical health concern, encouraging women to seek timely medical attention. The messages will be prominently displayed inside metro trains and at selected stations, making it easier for commuters to engage with the information. By leveraging the extensive reach of the metro system, the Health Ministry aims to foster a more informed public, particularly regarding issues that directly affect women's health. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to ensure that health education is accessible to all, regardless of their location or socioeconomic status. As the campaign rolls out, health officials hope to see a positive impact on women's health awareness and behavior across the capital.","bodyHtml":"","category":"68dcd15bce24e49a95f1064b","tags":["women's","health","Delhi","metro","health","campaign"],"era":"BC","imageUrl":"https://res.cloudinary.com/damjdyqj2/image/upload/news-images/manual/qwk6mlwglfodfhxfc8c2.png","imagePublicId":"news-images/manual/qwk6mlwglfodfhxfc8c2","imageAlt":"Delhi metro health awareness campaign","ogImage":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WiWBLpkH_L6SHfHmy2qLNTkJMAeAhcm6/view?usp=sharing","thumbImage":"https://res.cloudinary.com/damjdyqj2/image/upload/c_fill,g_auto,h_300,w_400,f_webp/news-images/google/qcgeyfw8jllvlsdmpqea","metaTitle":"Empowering Women Through Health Awareness in Delhi Metro","metaDesc":"Delhi's Health Ministry launches a metro campaign focusing on women's health, covering safety, mental health, and prenatal care.","readingTime":1,"status":"published","publishAt":"2025-12-10T06:47:19.000Z","source":"ai-batch","sourceUrl":"","geoMode":"global","geoAreas":["country:IN"],"createdAt":"2025-12-10T06:53:08.819Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-10T07:04:16.781Z","__v":0,"publishedAt":"2025-12-10T07:04:16.745Z","id":"693918d4f147c7a750fa5ab3"}
